What This Is
============

Controller program for the MHV Space Probe. Is designed to run in Lua
under Linux and talk to the probe's Arduino sketch via HTTP.

The controller also supports a simulation mode (set in config.lua)
whereby the probe reads its raw position from /tmp/space_probe_knob
and interacts with the user via stdout. See probe_sim.lua for details.

You can run the controller as 'lua main.lua' or you can run it in an
infinite loop as spaceprobe-loop.sh

Requirements
============

Designed to be as few as possible, and compatible w/ OpenWRT standard distribution.

* lua 5.1
* Libraries: luasocket, luaposix
* Executables: openssl executable (assumed to be on the path by default)

** On OpenWRT, packages are openssl-util, lua, luasocket (luaposix included w/ lua on current OpenWRT)
** On Debian/Ubuntu, packages are openssl, lua, liblua5.1-socket2, liblua5.1-posix1
** On other OSes, you're on your own. ;)


Configuration
=============

* Copy config.lua.tmpl to config.lua and edit to provide relevant
  credentials, details, calibrations
