Full details at http://www.makehackvoid.com/projects/space-probe/

* controller/ contains the Lua program, designed to run under Linux and
  talk to the probe itself. There is a separate (more detailed) README
  file in this directory.

* probe_firmware/Space_Probe/ contains the Arduino sketch which is
  designed to run on the probe itself, with a standard Arduino
  ethernet shield (or, in the case of the MHV space probe, a
  Freetronics EtherTen.)
